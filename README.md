# ML-DL-Model-Zoo

Welcome to the ML-DL Model Zoo! This repository is a comprehensive collection of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, showcasing a variety of models used in the field of artificial intelligence.

## About

This repository serves as a centralized location for various machine learning and deep learning models implemented using Python and PyTorch. It aims to provide clear, well-documented implementations to help you understand and apply these models in your projects.

## Repository Contents

Folders:

interpretability/: Contains models and scripts focused on model interpretability and explainability. These tools help in understanding how models make decisions and the factors influencing these decisions.

transformers/: Includes implementations of transformer models, which are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks for their powerful sequence-to-sequence capabilities.

Files:
interpretability/vision_transformer.py: Core implementation of interpretability techniques for vision transformers.

interpretability/notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook demonstrating interpretability methods and their applications.
transformers/transformer_model.py: Implementation of the transformer model architecture.
transformers/training_script.py: Script for training transformer models on various datasets.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and guidance on the repository.
